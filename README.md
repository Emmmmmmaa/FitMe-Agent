# AI Fashion Recommendation System

<!-- An intelligent fashion recommendation system built with Microsoft's AI technologies. -->
An intelligent fashion recommendation agent powered by image segmentation, multi-modal fusion, and large language models (LLMs). 

It supports retrieving clothing data from e-commerce purchase records (e.g., from Taobao) to enable personalized recommendations based on usersâ€™ purchase history. It also supports users to upload style images, select style scenes, and obtain a set of recommended outfit matching pictures along with recommendation reasons generated by an LLM.
